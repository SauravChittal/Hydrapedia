# Hydrapedia

This goes hand-in-hand with [Pokemon API](https://github.com/SauravChittal/Pokemon-API). If you haven't, make sure to change the port present in the project from 3000 to any other number.

Before starting, be sure to download [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) using whichever method works. 

After, you've setup Pokemon API and got it running, start Hydrapedia using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

### Starting the page

After running `npm start`, you should be greeted with a screen similar to this (it can take a long time for the page to load): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73107662/127932856-09965c32-6539-4116-824b-8e4c165d02f1.png)

### Entering in the information

Entering in the pokemon name is fairly straight-forward. You type your desired pokemon name(please be sure to use title case) within the text box like that: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73107662/127932789-0cc751ad-137a-4380-834e-ca423dd582ba.png)

### Retriving information

When you submit the name of the pokemon, the page reloads to give information about the said pokemon as such(Do note that "Type: " is a string which has been added manually): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73107662/127933153-f3550227-4ec2-4d2b-b7bd-2040403160f8.png)
